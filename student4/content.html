                        <h3>"Valkyrie"</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-info">
                        <p>At first sight, Valkyrie looks not unlike Iron Man, the glowing circle on her chest marking
                            her status (blue when motors are engaged, for example). But draw back the
                            infrared-transparent faceplate and instead of Tony Stark, you’ll find a whirring LIDAR
                            sensor that’s constantly scanning the surroundings for objects and obstacles.

                            Cameras and sensors abound on Valkyrie — in addition to a MultiSense SL camera on her head,
                            which combines laser, 3D stereo, and video to get a sense of the environment around her,
                            additional “hazard cameras” look ahead and behind from her torso. On each three-fingered
                            hand, 38 sensors help maintain dexterity. Numerous small motors (actuators, in
                            engineer-speak) control the robot’s 44 degrees of freedom, including seven-jointed arms.

                            The brains of the robot are two Intel Core i7 computers, which combine the sensors’ input
                            and determine the best course of action. And, while testing is generally done with a power
                            cord in place, Valkyrie also has a battery pack that’s good for about an hour.

                            All of that sensing, computing, and moving will be essential to Valkyrie’s future mission on
                            Mars. While NASA initially developed Valkyrie (or, as she was initially called, R5), for
                            disaster relief, in 2014 the agency changed course to reconfigure her for deep space. As one
                            of a class of "caretaker" robots, Valkyrie might help set up living compounds on Mars,
                            maintaining power and life support systems until the humans arrive.

                            Space Robotics Challenge
                            To that end, Valkyrie and the humans developing her are now facing space-based trials, such
                            as the the Space Robotics Challenge that takes place in June. Here’s the setup:

                            In the not too distant future, R5 has arrived on Mars along with supplies ahead of a human
                            mission. Overnight a dust storm damaged the habitat and solar array, and caused the primary
                            communication antenna to become misaligned. R5 must now repair an air leak in the habitat,
                            deploy a new solar panel, and align the communication antenna.

                            So basically, Valkyrie will replay the plot of The Martian, minus the part about growing
                            potatoes.</p>

                        <h3>"Privacy protection or intrusion? There’s a new tech that uses WiFi to see people through
                            walls"</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-info">
                        <p>Indoor surveillance is becoming valuable. It can help secure vulnerable individuals, such as
                            the growing numbers of elderly people living alone. These systems can spot when people fall
                            or do not move at all, they can detect intruders and provide peace of mind.

                            But this type of surveillance does not always work and can also be intrusive. Video camera
                            images can be hard to interpret when human bodies are partially occluded or when the light
                            is poor. And few people want surveillance cameras in places like bathrooms and bedrooms.

                            A better option would be a non-visual way to monitor indoor settings. But while radar and
                            lidar systems can be effective, they tend to be too expensive for most budgets.

                            Now a significantly cheaper option looks possible thanks to the work of Jiaqi Geng and
                            colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. This team has found a way to monitor
                            human movement in indoor environments using WiFi signals. They have even trained a neural
                            network to use these signals to recognise the specific pose of each human in a room. “This
                            paves the way for low-cost, broadly accessible, and privacy-preserving algorithms for human
                            sensing,” they say.

                            WiFi consists of low power radio signals at 2.4 GHz that encode data using various
                            protocols. Geng and co ignore the encoded data and look simply at the ratio of the
                            transmitted signal wave and the received wave. This depends on factors such as the distance
                            between the transmitting and receiving antennas and on an any objects in between that might
                            absorb, reflect or distort the signal.

                            A single transmitter and receiver obviously give limited information about 3D environments.
                            So Geng and co look instead at the signals from three transmitters and three receivers,
                            pointing out that many commercial WiFi transmitters have three antennas and so are well set
                            up for this.

                            Having cleaned the signals, Geng and co combine them to produce a two-dimensional feature
                            map that is similar to an image. But although this image captures the pose of any humans in
                            the room, it is not one the human eye could easily make sense of.

                            So the researchers have trained a neural network to recognise human poses instead. This is
                            possible because a neural network called DensePose already does this in the visual domain.
                            Geng and co applied this training to the WiFi domain using a technique called transfer
                            learning.

                            WiFi imaging
                            WiFi signals can reveal the pose of humans within an indoor environment (Source:
                            arxiv.org/abs/2301.00250)

                            The result is a system that can detect the pose of humans in a room based solely on the WiFi
                            signals passing through the environment. It Is not perfect, however. The team say their
                            system performs well at estimating the poses of human torsos but struggles in detecting
                            details like limbs.

                            It also needs to be entirely retrained every time the environment changes—when moved to a
                            different room, for example. “WiFi signals in different environments exhibit significantly
                            different propagation patterns,” say Geng and co. “Therefore, it is still a very challenging
                            problem to deploy our model on data from an untrained layout.”

                            That’s interesting work showing the potential for WiFi signals to be used to monitor indoor
                            environments, to detect falls or other potential problems.

                            However, it raises issues of its own. WiFi signals are detectable well beyond the confines
                            of most homes and offices and this raises the prospect of malicious users exploiting this
                            idea to monitor the activities of people behind closed doors. It immediately removes the
                            privacy of walls and curtains and although the resulting images are not “photographic”, this
                            raises important issues of both security and privacy.</p>
